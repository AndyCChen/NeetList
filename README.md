# NeetList

A simple web app to browse anime and create watch lists. It is built using react.js and next.js with
supabase as the backend, all written in typescript. I started this project just to apply my basic knowledge of react
on a building a proper website. Along the way i picked up next.js, typescript, and some basics with working with postgres.
Though much of the difficulty I experienced from this project was building all the frontend ui components with css and html.
